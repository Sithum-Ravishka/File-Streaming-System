# File Streaming System

The File Streaming System is a project that combines the power of Go-lang and Iden3 to implement file streaming, Merkle tree generation, and efficient file chunking and retrieval. This system is designed to provide a robust and scalable solution for managing large files, ensuring data integrity through Merkle trees, and enabling efficient retrieval of file chunks.

## Features

- **Go-lang Implementation:** Utilizes the Go programming language for its efficiency, concurrency support, and ease of use.

- **Iden3 Integration:** Incorporates Iden3 for Merkle tree implementation, which enhances data integrity and enables quick verification of file contents.

- **File Chunking:** Breaks down large files into smaller, manageable chunks, facilitating efficient storage and retrieval.

- **Streaming Support:** Enables the streaming of large files, making it suitable for scenarios with limited memory resources.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the File Streaming System locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/File-Streaming-System.git
   cd File-Streaming-System
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure that you have Go installed on your system. Install any additional dependencies specified in the project.
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. **Build and Run:**

   ```bash
   go run ./main.go
   go build
   ./File-Streaming-System
   ```
4. **Configuration:**

   Customize the configuration files or environment variables to match your specific requirements.

### Usage

Provide clear instructions on how to use the system. Include examples of file streaming, Merkle tree generation, and retrieval of file chunks.

**Example commands**
  ```bash
    ./File-Streaming-System stream-file /path/to/large/file
    ./File-Streaming-System generate-merkle-tree /path/to/large/file
    ./File-Streaming-System retrieve-file-chunk <chunk_id>
  ```
